- refactor remaining mega-modules into folders
- shouldn't be able to shoot projectiles when in camera transition or after switching camera modes or when deselecting ui lock
- actual water tiles: will need to bring in a shader and potentially find and mask out the world tiles that correspond to water
- grappling: on-foot medium-scale traversal
- landmarks: a list of landmarks around the world that the user can travel on, to be stored remotely at some point. initially extracted from Wikipedia, maybe?
- webgpu on web if possible
- scripted camera moves: a sequence of camera moves, potentially defined at runtime, capable of both micro- and macro- scale moves
- consider modifying the meshes to make way for roads in proximity - probably need to get local road data from OSM, but even then, can we do that kind of modification to the collision meshes? seems potentially quite gnarly
- instant teleport camera mode
- fix vehicle physics... again...
